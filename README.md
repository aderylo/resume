## Editing

Recommeded use of vscode with Latex Workshop extension for quick preview of changes. 
This extention needs latexmk installed to compile tex files as well as in case of current templete a few tex packages (unsuccessfull compilation logs will prompt you of missing pkgs). All can be downloaded via apt.
